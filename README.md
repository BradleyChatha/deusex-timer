# A speedrun timer for DeusEx GOTY edition on Linux & Proton/Wine.

In short: I wanted to speedrun this game, but it wasn't worth installing Windows just to have an accurate timer + autosplits. As load removal is actually pretty important for this game I decided to learn everything I needed to make my own timer with a load remover.

I want to add autosplitting (and splits in general) at some point, but it took me long enough to even get load removal sorted let alone bother trying to figure out the structure of Unreal's String type so I can read the parameter passed to LoadMap... which also has some complications I need to think about.
